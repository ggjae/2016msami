## Developing Android Application

Already, There are so many apps in the android market. And Market have HangYang apps like "ShuttleCock(To show ShuttleBus schedule for HYStudents)", "HY mobile app(Use HY-in in mobile)".

Many students think "Time is gold". So, They use many apps to save their time.
We make app for Hanyang University students(of course other univ.students) that profit even a little in time.

We will find some useful apps in git, make plans and designs.
