## Developing Android Application

Already, There are so many apps in the android market. And Market have HangYang apps like "ShuttleCock(To show ShuttleBus schedule for HYStudents)", "HY mobile app(Use HY-in in mobile)".

Many students think "Time is gold". So, They use many apps to save their time.
We make app for Hanyang University students(of course other univ.students) that profit even a little in time.

We will find some useful apps in git, make plans and designs.

Our Wiki's are here.

## After We....

We have accumulated git for one semester, but as a result of this, we are going to accumulate more git space of ourselves, more effort and the organization's 2016msami gives us convenience to Hanyang University students , And it would be better to become an application that would affect other schools.
 It was serious while working with the team, but it was fun to make things done. It seems that feelings are not bad when gathering and talking about the update later.
